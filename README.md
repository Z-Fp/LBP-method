# LBP-method
Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
The LBP methodology has led to significant progress in texture analysis. It is widely used all over the world both in research and applications. Due to its discriminative power and computational simplicity, the method has been very successful in many such computer vision problems which were not earlier even regarded as texture problems, such as face analysis and motion analysis.
